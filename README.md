Company Meeting Scheduler

Create an application that will list the scheduled meetings ordered by start time for a given date. When no date is selected or on first launch, fetch the schedule for today’s date. 
User should be able to schedule meeting for a particular date and time if that slot is available.

Fetch the data from the following endpoint http://fathomless-shelf-5846.herokuapp.com/api/schedule?date="7/8/2015" 
by querying for a particular date in dd/mm/yyyy format.
You will receive an json of already scheduled meetings(booked slots) for that date.
